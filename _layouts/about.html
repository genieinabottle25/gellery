                    This is the website that contains the memory of my journey on Planet Earth. With more than 20 years of observing, I found that this planet is getting attacked by its domain residents: human. they destroy forests; drop waste into the sea; Mutilate the same kind; launch wars; invent chemical weapons...  However, Planet Earth will not corrupt unless another planet flies by and crush it, human's deed will eventually destroy themselves.  
                    <br>
                    On the other side, I also witness the sparkling characteristics of mankind： they learn; they tried to understand other's grief and tried their best to ease them; they fight for freedom and equality for women, LGBTQ, and ethnic groups.  While the most important thing is: they love, it's such a strong feeling that makes the universe has its meaning to exist. 
                    <br>
                    Now the human is going through a tough period caused by Covid-19. In the next couple of decades' journey on Planet Earth, I will continue to observe and record with the camera, and try my best to make a difference.
